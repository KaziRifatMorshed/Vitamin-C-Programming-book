## 2. Write a C program to compare two files.

input ->
File1.txt

```

```
Files are not equal.
Line: 2, column: 14

## 3. Write a C program to copy contents from one file to another file.

Hint with Solution:

```c
~#include <stdio.h>
~#include <stdlib.h>
~
~int main(void) {
~
~  FILE *f1 = fopen("file3_1.txt", "r"), *f2 = fopen("file3_2.txt", "w");
~  if (f1 == NULL || f2 == NULL) {
~    printf("ERROR OPENING FILE");
~    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
~  }
~
~  char c1;
~  while (1) {
~    c1 = fgetc(f1);
    fputc(c1, f2); // focus
~    if (c1 == EOF) { // EOF has been written to f2 and now loop needs to be stopped
~      break;
~    }
~  }
~
~  fclose(f1), fclose(f2);
~} // DONE
```

## NOTE: the following four questions are previous lab test questions set by Dr Manishankar Mondal Sir on Strings. We have modified them to introduce file handling concepts.

## 11. Write a program that takes a file containing string with spaces from the user. Your program will then determine the following and save them in txt files.

1. Find the individual words and store them in a two-dimensional array. Save the words.
2. Count the number of vowels in each word. Save the counts for all words in a file.
3. Print the appearance counts of the distinct words? Draw a histogram considering the appearance counts and save them in another file.

Sample Input file `input.txt`:

```
I know the man. the man is a good human being. the man has good characteristics. man man man man  the the the the good good
```

First Output file:

```
I, vowel count = 1
know, vowel count = 1
the, vowel count = 1
man, vowel count = 1
the, vowel count = 1
man, vowel count = 1
is, vowel count = 1
a, vowel count = 1
good, vowel count = 2
human, vowel count = 2
being, vowel count = 2
the, vowel count = 1
man, vowel count = 1
has, vowel count = 1
good, vowel count = 2
characteristics, vowel count = 5
man, vowel count = 1
man, vowel count = 1
man, vowel count = 1
man, vowel count = 1
the, vowel count = 1
the, vowel count = 1
the, vowel count = 1
the, vowel count = 1
good, vowel count = 2
good, vowel count = 2
```

Second output file `distinct_words_appearance_counts.txt`:

```
I: *
know: *
the: ***
man: ***
is: *
a: *
good: ****
human: *
being: *
has: *
characteristics: *
```

## 12. Assume that you have an array of 20 positive integers in a file. Write a program to RECURSIVELY determine the SUMMATION of all prime integers in the array. You SHOULD write the prime testing function recursively. The array will be taken as input from file and append the answer to the input file at last.

input.txt

```
4
345
45
78
324
5
45
453
435
37
78
423
453
34
578
31
374
19
11
111
```

output:

```
4
345
45
78
324
5
45
453
435
37
78
423
453
34
578
31
374
19
11
111
sum:103
```

***

## 13. Write a program to take a string with spaces from a file. Your program will save the string to `output.txt` after trimming it. Let us assume that the input string is "        I live in a beautiful        village.           ". Your program will remove the spaces from the front and back of the string and then save it. Thus, the output will be "I live in a beautiful        village." For trimming (i.e., for removing spaces from the front and back) you need to create a user-defined function called "trimstring" that takes a string as a parameter.

***

## 14. "LTrim", "RTrim", and "MTrim", and "CountOccurrence"

Write a program that will take a string with spaces from file as input. Write four functions named "LTrim", "RTrim", and "MTrim", and "CountOccurrence". Each of these functions will take a string as a parameter.

"LTrim" will delete all the spaces from the left hand side of the parameter string and will return the string that will be obtained after deleting the left side spaces.

"RTrim" will delete all the spaces from the right hand side of the parameter string and will return the string that will be obtained after deleting the right side spaces.

"MTrim" will keep only one space between every two consecutive words. There can be multiple spaces between two words in a string. Only one space will be kept and other spaces will be deleted.

And, "CountOccurrence" will recursively count the occurrences of "abc" in a parameter string and will return the count. This function might also take other parameters as you wish to accomplish the task.
