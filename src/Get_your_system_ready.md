### 1. Editor Setup

Considering you as newbies we are only going to suggest 2 editors (each) here. If you have any problems installing them then [contact us](https://structured-programming-ku-cse.blogspot.com/2024/06/document-body-font-size-20px-table-min.html#). Until you've got some hands on experience it is better to stick with the **first** options in both cases.

## Hello World

The typical first program...

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello World);
    return 0;
}
```

fun fact, it is a 7 line code, but same work can be achieved with only 2 lines of code!

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){printf("Hello World");}
```

Write this code character by character in your preferred code editor and run. If everything is alright then you will see your computer welcoming you to the world of programming.

Now let's get you started on your learning journey. Choose any of the following ones to start. If you love to read and you can understand well from reading then you may choose option 1. Otherwise choose the other options. (Those are videos. I'll suggest that you try both and then decide.)
