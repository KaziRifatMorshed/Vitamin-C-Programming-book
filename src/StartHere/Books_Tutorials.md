# Learning Resources

> *A gentle reminder...*\
> This book is prepared as a supplement to your mainstream learning resource (like Youtube Playlist or any Bangladeshi Book). After Completing topics from your main learning source, you can find additional knowledge and practice problems here. Do not take this book as your main book to learn as we have skipped many things believing that you will learn them in your class or youtube lecture.

Now let's get you started on your learning journey. Choose any of the following ones to start. If you love to read and you can understand well from reading then you may choose option 1. Otherwise choose the other options. (Those are videos. I'll suggest that you try both and then decide.)
