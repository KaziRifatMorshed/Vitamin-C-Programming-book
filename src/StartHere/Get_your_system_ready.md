## 1. Editor and Compiler Setup

Considering you as newbies we are only going to suggest 2 editors (each) here. If you have any problems installing them thenÂ [contact us](https://structured-programming-ku-cse.blogspot.com/2024/06/document-body-font-size-20px-table-min.html#). Until you've got some hands on experience it is better to stick with theÂ **first**Â options in both cases.

We prefer to use VS Code and MSYS2 compiler.

## Hello, check, check !

The typical first program to check whether compiler, IDE are working or not...

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello World);
    return 0;
}
```

fun fact, it is a 7 line code, but same work can be done with only 2 lines of code!

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){printf("Hello World");}
```

Write this code character by character in your favorite code editor and run. If everything is alright then you will see your computer welcoming you to the world of programmingðŸ˜‰.
